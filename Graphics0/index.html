Assignment 0 - Why I'm Here
</ul>
<ul>

Video games have always fascinated me. As a child, I lived in a neighborhood in which my age was probably a 
good standard deviation or three under the mean, which meant that, while others might have played outside, I 
found my solace in games like Final Fantasy and World of Warcraft. These games expanded my imagination, and ever 
since then I've wanted to create my own (of course, reading shelves upon shelves' worth of fantasy books helped as well).

When VR first became a serious topic of discussion, right around the time of Oculus Rift's debut on Kickstarter, 
I started to formulate an idea about how my desire to make a game could break the mold of video games being solely 
for entertainment purposes - I wanted to make video games that help in education, because I felt that the virtual 
space could do way more than what any 2D media could accomplish. I wanted to make a VR game that could help recovering 
physical therapy patients increase their chances of success, by providing them with short-term motivation as well as 
to give them a sense of escapism, by immersing them in this 3D headspace.

As such, the reason I want to take this class it to understand 3D graphics more, and learn how I can take advantage 
of the technology that is at our fingertips. I hope to use the Unity and Oculus DK2 support that we will receive to 
really learn about game development on these platforms, and kickstart my idea.
